# TeachMood

This project is a complete **Facial Emotion Detection System**, which includes:
- **Frontend**: A web-based user interface for interacting with the model.
- **Backend**: A server that processes images and returns predictions.
- **Browser Extension**: A Chrome extension for real-time emotion detection in video calls.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A CNN-based model trained to detect facial emotions.

## Features
- **Real-time Emotion Detection** using OpenCV and Deep Learning.
- **Web Interface** for uploading and analyzing images.
- **REST API** for backend processing and model inference.
- **Browser Extension** for seamless real-time emotion analysis during video calls.
- **Optimized Deep Learning Model** trained on a large dataset.

## Tech Stack
### **Frontend**
- React.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### **Backend**
